				<h1>Donut's Development</h1>
		<p> Donut was developed in a variaty of languages to give the best experience to all its users, it was mainly developed in Python and JavaScript, the website was developed with HTML and CSS markup, the bot was developed over months and tested a lot to gurantee satisfaction for all of its users! Python is responsible for the main bot's system and the backend webpage routes making it very vital to the development. On the other hand JavaScript is responsible for a number of things, first, it is responsible for dealing with requests made from the website on the dashboard to change things in servers, second, its responsible for some of the image manipulation within the bot, last, it is responsible for any other frontend functions in the webpage. HTML is used for the actual content on the webpage and CSS is just there to style it!
